## What this does?
This repo along with https://github.com/saha-rajdeep/kubernetesmanifest creates a Jenkins pipeline with GitOps to deploy code into a Kubernetes cluster. CI part is done via Jenkins and CD part via ArgoCD (GitOps).

## Jenkins installation
Jenkins is installed on EC2. Follow the instructions on https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/tutorial-for-installing-jenkins-on-AWS/ . You can skip "Configure a Cloud" part for this demo. Please note some commands from this link might give errors, below are the workarounds:

1. If you get daemonize error while running the command `sudo yum install jenkins java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y` then , run the commands from the answer of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68806741/how-to-fix-yum-update-of-jenkins

2. Install Docker on the EC2 after Jenkins is installed by following the instructions on https://serverfault.com/questions/836198/how-to-install-docker-on-aws-ec2-instance-with-ami-ce-ee-update

3. Run `sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock` on the EC2 after Docker is installed.

4. Install Git on the EC2 by running `sudo yum install git`

## Jenkins installation - better alternative
Pre-Requisites:

Java (JDK)
Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins
Install Java

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
Verify Java is Installed

java -version
Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

EC2 > Instances > Click on
In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
Security groups
Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed All traffic).

Login to Jenkins using the below URL:
http://:8080 [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]

Note: If you are not interested in allowing All Traffic to your EC2 instance 1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance 2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port 8080

After you login to Jenkins, - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword - Enter the Administrator password
